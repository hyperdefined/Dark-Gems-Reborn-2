#### 1. I cannot craft/find Dark Gems!
In that case, check the configuration to match what you want. By default, Dark Ore spawns.

#### 2. I want to put this in a Skyblock modpack, is there a way to?
I am not offering support for Skyblock modpacks. If you do add this, then there is no way to find Shards. So you cannot make new Gems.

#### 3. I crashed!
Read the log and make sure it is my mod. (Test this by removing Dark Gems Reborn 2.) If you only crash when Dark Gems Reborn 2 is present, then open a new issue here: https://github.com/hyperdefined/dark-gems-reborn-2/issues
