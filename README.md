# Dark Gems Reborn 2 - Archive
**This is an archive of Dark Gems Reborn 2, a mod I worked on between August 2015 to June 2017.**

Dark Gems Reborn 2 adds new Gems that can be used for tools and armor.

List of Gems:
* Magical (Best tier)
* Blue Gem
* Green Gem
* Infused Gem
* Dark Gem (Worst tier)

Note: Textures will be changing in updates, so some item's texture will not be the same as the pictures.
## Getting Started
You need to find or craft Dark Gems. You can only craft Dark Gems when you disable the Dark Ore generation in the configuration. If you do not disable it, you will have to find it. Dark Ore spawns under layer 30 by default.

You also need a Dark Hammer to make new Gems.
## Shards
Shards are used to make new Gems. You can find them under layer 30 by default.
## Tools and Armor
Each Gem has a set of tools and armor. Use the Minecraft vanilla recipes to make each one.
## Configuration
Change the configuration in game (Mods > Dark Gems Reborn 2 > Config) or at `/config/darkgemsreborn2/config.cfg`

You can change the Y level of the ores, change if Dark Ore spawns, or change the start message.

All require a game restart!
